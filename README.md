# Neuroscope

An interactive neural network visualization engine for both artificial and biological neural networks, designed to make neural architectures and their dynamics accessible and interpretable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

### Using flox and uv (Recommended)

[flox](https://flox.dev) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) provide a streamlined development environment setup:

1. Install flox:
   - Download from [flox.dev](https://flox.dev)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your platform

2. Install uv:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   # Initialize flox environment
   flox init
   flox install nodejs

   # Create Python virtual environment with uv
   uv venv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Share the environment:
   - The `.flox` directory contains everything needed to run this environment
   - Others can use `flox activate` after cloning the repository
   - For team collaboration:
     ```bash
     flox push  # Share via FloxHub
     # Others can then use:
     flox pull username/neuroscope
     # or
     flox activate -r username/neuroscope
     ```

### Traditional Setup
If you prefer not to use flox/uv, follow the manual setup instructions below.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Visualize Your Own Model

1. Start the services:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start Python service
cd python_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload  # Use python3 on Linux/Mac
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000/demo

3. Drag and drop your PyTorch model file (`.pt` or `.pth`) or visualization data (`.json`)

### Option 2: Try the MNIST Example

1. Set up the environment:
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
cd python_service
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Use pip3 on Linux/Mac
```

2. Run the example:
```bash
cd python_service
python -m examples.mnist_cnn  # Use python3 on Linux/Mac
```

3. Start the services:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start Python service
cd python_service
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload  # Use python3 on Linux/Mac
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000/demo

5. Drag and drop:
   - `python_service/models/mnist_initial.pt` for initial architecture
   - `python_service/models/mnist_final.pt` for trained model
   - `python_service/neuroscope_training.json` for training dynamics

See `python_service/examples/README.md` for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

## üéØ Vision

Neuroscope bridges the gap between complex neural systems and human understanding through interactive, web-based visualizations. Inspired by Manim's mathematical animations but tailored for neural networks, Neuroscope provides an intuitive interface for exploring both artificial and biological neural architectures.
